# matplotlib_visualizations
This involves a technical analysis on data from a most recent animal study by pymaceuticals inc to compare the performance of the drug Capomulin against other treatments.

To do this, visualizations are made using Matplotlib, and also Summary statics are applied to the tumor volume associated with each drug regimane. For more indepth analysis, quartiels and outliers are found
and analysis on correlation and regression is carried out.

#SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
From the analysis, it is observed that there is less variability in the Capomulin drug, this is derived from its variance which is recorded as. it is more stable and less likely to cause an increase in tumor volume when compared
with the other treatments.There is also a positive correlation(r>0) 0.84 between the mouse_weight ahd the tumor_volume when looking at the capomulin drug as the mouse weight increases with the average tumor volume.for a better comparison
this correlation could have been applied to other drug regimens. The Capomulin drug doesnt contain any potential outliers when analyzed which confirms the mean of the data set is not being skewed as such Capomulin could be considered a more
suitable medication when compared to the rest of the drugs.
